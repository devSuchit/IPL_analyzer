The dataset was initially cleaned, removing all the players who will not be appearing in the 2019 match.
Any discrepancies and missing valued rows were filled with necessary values and normalised.
The program is executed under the iPython console and was built by using spyder.
Implementation of data analytics occurred via python application where we used Pandas and Numpy to extract and read the data from CSV files into data frames on which the program can run on.
The program evaluated the categorised players and gave a corresponding value for each year, these values were used
by a model to learn and extrapolate player's value for 2019 IPL.
Finally the players were sorted according to their predicted scores and selected based on the constraints given by the program and written into OUTPUT CSV file.
